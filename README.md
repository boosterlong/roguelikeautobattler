A fun Expo-CLI-built React-Native game.

You fight randomly generated enemies and strategically decide to attack or heal. After each round pick an upgrade and see how far you can get. (My record is 11 rounds)
I plan on giving the game a Gameboy aesthetic with buttons to match. Currently on the backburner.
